# CloudCasting UI

## 🌥️ Overview
CloudCasting UI is an innovative project focused on visualizing cloud forecasts using satellite imagery. Our goal is to create an intuitive and engaging representation of cloud movements, aiding weather forecasting and solar energy applications.

## 📌 Why This Project?
We've been working on forecasting clouds using satellite imagery, and now it's time to bring those forecasts to life with compelling visualizations. This UI will help users understand cloud patterns in an interactive and insightful way. 

## 🚀 Where Will It Be Used?
The CloudCasting UI could be integrated into our existing product, **Quartz Solar Forecast**, or developed as a standalone tool.

## ✨ Features (Planned)
- **Dynamic Cloud Visualization**: Animated cloud movements based on satellite data.
- **Intuitive UI**: Clean, interactive interface for users.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Live updates to ensure accurate forecasting.
- **Customizable Views**: Multiple layers and filters for detailed analysis.
